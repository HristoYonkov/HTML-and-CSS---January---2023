------------------------POZITIONING ELEMENTS------------------------
1 - static => Cant use top, bottom, left, right properties in css!
2 - relative => Same position, and saves original place, but u can use top, bottom, left, right properties in css, and leave empty space on original position!
3 - absolute => Use position of parent element different from "static" starts on top left corner, also most of cases we need to defined their width!
4 - fixed => Positioned acording to the browser screen: navbars, browse top buttons and etc..!
5 - sticky => Positioned according to the element stick on the parent borders or browser screen (when scrolling). Also is looking for a parent scroll and stick on the parent element borders.

- difference between '%' and 'vh' => '%' is positioning base on the parent!
- transform: translate(-50%, -50%); => position the element -50% of it's sizes - (X, Y)!
- z-index => works only if position is different from static!
- z-index: if z-indexes properties works in the scope of his parent with 'z-index' they are working only for this scope!
